        Ingredients
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti uncooked</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef extra lean</li>
            <li>1 large onion chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oregano dried</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine</li>
            <li>28 ounce crushed tomatoes (1 can)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon basil chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon pepper or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ cup Parmesan cheese grated</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon basil chopped, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions. Keep the pasta water, in case needed for sauce.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook for 3 minutes, breaking it as you go, until no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and garlic and cook for another 3 minutes until the onion softens.</li>
            <li>Add the oregano, red pepper flakes, tomato paste and stir. Stir in the red wine and cook for about 5 minutes until most of the liquid has cooked off.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, basil and season with salt and pepper. Stir and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a medium-low. Cover the pot and cook for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the heavy cream and adjust for seasoning if needed. If your sauce is too thick add some of the pasta water to thin it out.</li>
            <li>Add the spaghetti to the pot and toss well with the sauce. Top with Parmesan cheese and basil. Serve immediately.</li>
