# odin-recipes

This is my first project for the Odin Project!

Recipes contains 3 recipes from https://www.allrecipes.com/ and https://www.jocooks.com/

This project is made with HTML. Basic HTML Boilerplate, ordered and unordered lists, <strong> and <em> tags. I also resize images in 2 pages because the original images were big enough to cover the whole view.
